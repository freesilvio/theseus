=======

A port of https://github.com/jamis/theseus over to AS3.

Theseus is a utility written by Jamis Buck, and released into the wild with a very generous license. It feels only fair to give him the proper credit for writing such a comprehensive library for mazes.

Only problem with it is that it's in Ruby and that's not a language I'm familiar with.  So I'm converting this into AS3.  Which should make porting it into other similar languages (Java, C#, etc) easier.  

Worse that can happen, I got some exercise both in AS3 and in reading a language I don't know (Ruby).

Once I'm done, I'll update the readme file with usage information.
